We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet. Project Galileo : Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost. Athenian Project : In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states. 1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers. Sound like something you’d like to be a part of?

Annual Salary: $270,000 &mdash; $270,000 USD Logistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience. Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: &nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

Our focus is on solving difficult problems to connect and protect users, applications, and data, while helping to make the Internet more resilient, efficient, and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In our quest to help make a better Internet, we frequently find ourselves exploring open problems at the boundaries of knowledge in scalable computing, with a focus on security and&amp;nbsp; privacy, using techniques including AI/ML and performance analysis.&amp;nbsp; We make cutting edge research contributions in-house, as well as in collaboration with academia, Internet standards organizations like the IETF, and more!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our team includes experts in many disciplines, including applied cryptography, privacy, network architectures and protocols, measurement, distributed systems, storage optimization, machine learning for systems, and more.&amp;nbsp; We seek interns that augment our existing expertise as well as those who are working in broadly related areas. We have a vast set of potential projects focussed on our current priorities. We also welcome new ideas via concrete proposals that, more than just satisfying curiosity, may help to improve Cloudflare or aspects of the Internet and surrounding technologies touched by Cloudflare. We are, after all, researchers at heart and love learning, too!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More information about Cloudflare&#39;s approach to research can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-approach-to-research/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare&#39;s Research Team solves difficult problems in security, privacy, and systems at scale. This involves engineering, data analysis, open source software development, protocol design, implementation of primitives, with lots of measurement alongside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Successful candidates will be matched to suitable projects in on-going research directions. We also welcome novel proposals and ideas that can help to inform or build a better Internet (in the form of a max 200 word proposal).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Internet is evolving in ways that challenge convention, and many existing assumptions no longer hold. Interns and internship projects are designed to help maintain the integrity of the Internet, its systems, and its applications. Some of the fundamental areas we’re investigating focus on include advanced cryptography, hardware isolation, balancing user privacy against notions of identity, network and internetwork observability in a seemingly fragmented world, even applications of formal methods at scale — and this is just a small view into our &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.cloudflare.com/outreach/updates/&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;!

We’re also acutely aware that AI will impact all layers of a globally distributed system and the wider Internet. General Research Intern Requirements Evidence of tackling hard or open-ended problems Proven track record of peer-reviewed research, open-source software contributions, or standards development, that is commensurate with level of training --- students at all levels are welcome to apply Experience clearly communicating research ideas through papers, pre-prints, standards documents, blogs, or similar media Ability to work in a systems-level programming language (e.g. Rust, C, Go)&nbsp; Passion for debugging and ensuring system reliability Familiarity with continuous integration workflows and source control systems (e.g., Gitlab, Github) Willing and eager to share knowledge, with the skills to do so Additional Requirements Knowledge or experience with at least one of the following: Computer networking protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, BGP, QUIC, etc.) and related algorithms Machine learning analysis, ideally in systems or network optimization Authentication protocols, applied cryptography, PKI and SSL/TLS Operating or distributed systems analysis or development Measurement for network and computer systems Proficiency in a scripting language, such as Python &nbsp; Bonus Points: Proven track record of independently driving projects in a fast-paced environment Experience working in groups, or with multiple stakeholders Able to fluently work across multiple programming languages Internship Availability and Expectations: Ability to commit to a 12 week summer internship In office 3-4 days a week in London, UK What Makes Cloudflare Special? We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet. Project Galileo : Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost. Athenian Project : In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states. 1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers. Sound like something you’d like to be a part of?

Security at Cloudflare ensures that this massive flow of traffic remains secure and resilient against evolving threats. While our core engineering teams build the software that handles traffic, our security engineers build the systems that protect it. Technologies we use to defend the Internet include Go, Rust, Python, and C/C++.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Internship Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ideal Security Engineering intern is passionate about making the Internet a more secure place.
