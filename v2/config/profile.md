I am a CS-oriented candidate focused on software engineering, data engineering, applied AI and applied machine learning.
Strengths: Python, Java, C/C++, Mysql, SQL, vue.js, React, Github Action, reproducible workflows, data pipelines, GitHub automation, LLM tooling, fast learning.
Looking for internships/co-ops or entry-level roles without citizenship/security clearance requirements.
Location preference:
- Open to US-based roles; remote or hybrid is fine.
- If location matters, I prefer roles that can support students/interns without citizenship/clearance constraints.
Interested domains: AI/ML systems, software development, tooling, automation agents, cloud data workflows.
Prefer roles with: Python, APIs, data processing, ML pipelines, LLM/RAG, software engineering fundamentals, product design, product manager, UI/UX.
Avoid: roles requiring US citizenship, security clearance, polygraph, or heavy hardware-only focus.
